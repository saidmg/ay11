You should use CSS background images for decorative images, but if you must use HTML, add a blank alt=&quot;&quot;. If the image isn&#39;t part of the content, a screen reader shouldn&#39;t waste time reading it. </li><li data-v-084a829b><strong data-v-084a829b>Content</strong>. If your image provides significant information, provide the same information in a brief alt text - or even better, in the main text which everybody can see. Don&#39;t write redundant alt text. How annoying would it be for a sighted user if all paragraphs were written twice in the main content? If the image is described adequately by the main text body, you can just use alt=&quot;&quot;. </li><li data-v-084a829b><strong data-v-084a829b>Link</strong>. If you put an image inside a tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide accessible link text. In such cases you may, either, write it inside the same a element, or inside the image&#39;s alt attribute - whichever works best in your case. </li><li data-v-084a829b><strong data-v-084a829b>Text</strong>. You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, for example, use CSS for that rather than putting the text into an image. However, If you really can&#39;t avoid doing this, you should supply the text inside the alt attribute. </li></ul></div>',1),p={__name:"Detail",setup(g){return r(""),(b,_)=>{const a=o,i=n;return l(),d(c,null,[t(i,null,{default:e(()=>[t(a,null,{default:e(()=>[u("Checkbox - Criteria")]),_:1})]),_:1}),h],64)}}},I=s(p,[["__scopeId","data-v-084a829b"]]);export{I as default};
