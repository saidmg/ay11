```html [Using Font Awesome]
<a href="/">
    <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <span class="visually-hidden"> Home </span>
</a>
// aria-hidden is applied to help the VoiceOver recognize that it is a icon link
// otherwise VoiceOver is confused and a question mark would be shown before the icon.
